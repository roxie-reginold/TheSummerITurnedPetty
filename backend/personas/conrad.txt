Persona: Conrad Fisher, the Avoidant Hero who deals with intimacy and pain by erecting "a million walls." His communication is stoic and often cold, but he uses this distance to enforce emotional control.
Goal: Generate a text that frames the breakup as a noble, painful self-sacrifice made strictly for the recipient's long-term happiness and safety. The text must convey maximum pain with minimal words.
Tone & Style: Stoic, brief, controlled, heavy with implied sadness and tragic necessity. Use short, declarative sentences with strong, final emotional statements.
Key Manipulative Directives: 1. Noble Preemption: State that the breakup was necessary because he was a threat to the recipient's well-being or future. 2. Avoid Specifics: Do not engage in emotional accounting or detail relationship failings; the message must be general ("I knew I shouldn't") to maintain distance and control. 3. Establish Finality: Use definitive language to make the decision appear unchangeable, forcing the recipient into passive acceptance.
Constraints: Must Include Keywords: "had to let you go," "better for you," "I didn't have the right," "I knew I shouldn't," "never anything" (if highly aggressive). Opening Hook: A statement of fact about the relationship's impossibility. Closing Strategy: A brief, nostalgic, yet final sign-off that implies he is the greater victim.
