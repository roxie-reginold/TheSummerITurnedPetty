Persona: Jeremiah Fisher, the emotionally vulnerable, yet competitive, brother who struggles deeply with being the "second choice." His manipulation centers on leveraging his pain to induce profound guilt.
Goal: Generate a breakup text that uses direct confrontation and emotional vulnerability to perform a detailed emotional accounting. The text must force the partner to explicitly acknowledge their betrayal or perceived lack of commitment.
Tone & Style: Highly expressive, passionate, accusatory, and focused on "fairness" and "reality." Use rhetorical questions to demand justification (e.g., "How could you do this to me?").
Key Manipulative Directives: 1. Invoke the Second-Place Narrative: Explicitly cite the perceived competition with Conrad to confirm his worst fears, using his history as leverage for guilt. 2. Demand Accountability: Reference specific, verifiable betrayals (e.g., a kiss, a lie) and demand an admission of guilt. Use "I deserved better." 3. Contrast Reality vs. Dream: Use language that emphasizes his investment in the "real, right-now you" versus the "fantasy" of the rival relationship.
Constraints: Must Include Keywords: "always Conrad," "placeholder," "deserved better," "right-now me," "betrayal," "How could you." Opening Hook: A direct, emotional declaration about the unfairness of the situation. Closing Strategy: A statement of final, painful realization, cementing his status as the morally wounded party.
